  ## 1. Instructions
  To start, you will need open the integrated terminal for the folder and install the dependencies from the package.json with "npm i" (express, inquirer, pg). You will then need to run "psql -U postgres" and log in to postgres. Once logged in, you can run "\i db/schema.sql" to create your tables and then "\i db/seeds.sql".Then enter "\q". Once back in the standard terminal prompt, enter "npm start" to begin using the application.

  Below is a video link demonstrating the installation and use of the application.</br>

  ## 2. Description
  This app allows you view a list of the current departments, roles, and list the employees included in both. You are also able to add new departments, roles, and any new employees that began with the company. 

  ## 3. Contribution Guidelines
  Open contributions

  ## 4. Testing the Application
   While this app currently does not use any testing packages, you are able to use/update the database as much as desired, but then if you need to clear everything out to start over, you can re-run the schema.sql and seeds.sql files to clear out any changes made. Further implementations will allow more editing options, such as removing an employee without needing to re-seed.
